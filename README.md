# Please download the pretrained NanoGPT model on QA data from the [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gIZw-HAB-tHtEYCmNugwlIV7R3WsgjjZ/view?usp=sharing), and place it into the folder `./sft`!

# If you have any questions, please feel free to open an issue on GitHub, and I will respond.

Keep gpt.pt locally for each collaborator.

Each person working on the project downloads gpt.pt separately from the original source and places it in sft/.

Since it’s in .gitignore, it won’t be pushed to GitHub, so your repo stays under GitHub’s 100 MB limit.
